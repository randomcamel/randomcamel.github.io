+1 to always having them. set the time aside for them and make sure they know it. most of my 1-1s are 10-15 minutes, but boy howdy sometimes it takes the 30 minutes or more.

for new reports, be aware that they don't know what kind of manager you are, and maybe they don't even know you as a person at all, so I allow time for getting to know each other as two humans together, and as trust builds, honor and acknowledge the level of trust that actually exists, and if I need to presume upon it, I'll tell them.

I manage via trust relationships, because otherwise everything gets really really hard: you want to do a re-org, or make a process change, or pivot the team to something new for whatever reason, if they don't trust you to do your damnedest to take care of them individually and as a team, it will be a trainwreck.

I keep a google doc with 1-1 notes, that also keeps their personal details up at the top: spouse, kids & their ages, pets. there's no way I'd remember it otherwise, and it sends a huge signal that I'm interested in them as a person (which I am, because that's what they are).

okay clearly I should write a doc
