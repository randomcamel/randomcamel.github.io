As software engineers, we can recoil from the idea of "process." Or maybe *Process™*, to give it the proper air of menace.

I won't even say we're wrong. The flaws of ineffective organizations find fig leaves of legitimacy under the idea that process is the goal, instead of a tool to help us reach a goal. To empire-builders, if you <strike>design</strike> inflict a process with lots of meetings, your ability to command others' time becomes a source of power or influence. Waterfall processes, because Waterfall is terrible, are especially susceptible: a stakeholder can sign off on a set of requirements, come back the next quarter, say "The business environment changed! You can just do something completely different real fast, right?" and unless your boss has been diligently politicking in the meantime, your stakeholder gets to show how they say "Jump" and you say "How high?".

As with anything we're spending money/time/goodwill on, our first question is: "Why are we doing this?" What do we want a process *for*? 

Process is a known path for the routine stuff, and contingency plans for the unusual. It’s meant to guide strongly, not to rule.
